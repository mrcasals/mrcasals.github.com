It's been really long since the last time I wrote a post. A lot of things have
happened since: I started the second semester at university, I got angry with
the educational model they're using there and I'm trying to change it. I started
organizing the [Barcelona Ruby Conference 2012 (BaRuCo)][baruco] (which looks
amazing, I must say) with the people at [Codegram][codegram-web]. I improved my
VIm knowledge. I learned about design patterns and became kind of obsessed with
them. I got an Android smartphone. And I found myself with the need of a place
where to talk about all those things.

But sometimes it's better to get rid of everything to start again instead of
trying to keep something alive. That's what I did with the blog: I had one, but
I didn't use it. Now I find myself with the need of a place to save my thoughts
and things I do... But I couldn't use the older blog. It was too unupdated and I
screwed the repo at some point, so I just deleted it and created a new one.

I don't need a change, I just need to start again. That's why I'm still using
[Octopress][octopress]. Besides, Octopress has implemented some nice features
since the last time I took a look at it, such as separating plugins into their
own system or linked posts, which are still in beta (but I'd love to see them
merged in master). Oh, and I just love writing posts with Markdown and VIm :)

The only drawback I find using Octopress is the lack of themes. I just can't
stand another blog with this layout. Too mainstream, I'd say. So I'll try to
create my own layout for this blog, which will be a funny challenge because I'll
have to design something useful _from zero to hero_ and take a look at Octopress
templating system (about which I could not find any docs... shame on you!).

I'm also thinking about taking a look at Octopress' plugins system, which looks
quite nice and easy to work with. I've already got a plugin in mind related to
Spotify and it will take me to create a gem to work with its API, so three
things in one :)

PS: this reminds me that I have to do a cleanup to me GitHub account... So much
stupid repos there.
